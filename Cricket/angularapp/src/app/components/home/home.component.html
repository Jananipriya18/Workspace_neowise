    <h1>Cricket Event Management System   </h1>
    <p>
      The Cricket Event Management System is a sophisticated platform designed to streamline and facilitate the organization and management of cricket events. This comprehensive application caters to the diverse requirements of both administrators (admins) overseeing the entire system and event organizers responsible for planning and executing specific cricket events. Admins can leverage the system to efficiently handle tasks such as participant registrations, scheduling matches, managing venues, and overseeing overall logistics. On the other hand, event organizers benefit from tools that enable them to plan and coordinate various aspects of cricket events seamlessly.
